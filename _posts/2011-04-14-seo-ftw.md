April 14th at 13:30 I'll give a lecture about the basics of
_Search Engine Optimization_ (a.k.a. _SEO_), is going to be a lot of fun!

The event is sponsored by [Wikia] and will be hosted by
[Poznan University of Technology], if you won't be able to join you can still go
through the the [slides deck].

**DISCLAIMER**: those slides are meant to be accompanied by a voice commentary
that describes and explains in detail each concept/idea/picture/joke, soon I'll
release a "standalone" set of slides with the speaker's notes at
[robimy.wikia.com] later on.

**Update 14th Apr 2011**: The lecture went pretty smooth, people didn't fall
asleep (thanks to a good dose of jokes), got some good ratings/comments and some
tips to improve the slides; I'm actually planning to do it once again, different
target next time.

**Update 18th Apr 2011**: I've reworked the [slides deck], they now come also with a
full transcript.
